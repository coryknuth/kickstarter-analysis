Secondly, based on these statistics, the campaign goal amount which will maximize your success would be around $4000.00 maximum. Certainly not more than $5,000.00. Theatre Campaigns which set too high of funding goals have much higher chance of failure, and the cutoff number is right around that $4000-$5000 mark.
