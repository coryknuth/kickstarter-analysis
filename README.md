First, The months of May, June, and July had significantly higher chances of success for projects in this category, with the weakest launch dates being through the winter. We strongly reccomend an early summer start date for your campaign.

Secondly, based on these statistics, the campaign goal amount which will maximize your success would be around $4000.00 maximum. Certainly not more than $5,000.00. Theatre Campaigns which set too high of funding goals have much higher chance of failure, and the cutoff number is right around that $4000-$5000 mark.

In summary, our analysis indicates a campaign to fund a threatrical production on Kickstarter, launched in the early summer, with a funding goal NO higher than $5,000.00 has the best likelihood of being successfully funded.
